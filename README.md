# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5




Background Info

You'll write Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
