# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5




Background Info

You'll write Python scripts using Pandas libraries, the Jupyter Notebook, and Matplotlib to create a variety of charts that showcase the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations you produce will help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.


create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. 
using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

get the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then, calculate the average fare per ride and average fare per driver for each city type. Finally, add this data to a new DataFrame, then format the columns.
