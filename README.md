# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this analysis is to use Pandas libraries, Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib to show the realationships between the locations of cities (Rural, SubUrban or Urban) and the number of drivers and riders.  The analysis will also show the percentage of fares, riders and drivers in their respective city types.   This analysis will provide date needed to make adjustments to the ridesharing services and to assist in improving the price point and affordability in underserved neighbourhoods.


## Results

The results of our analysis show that there are distinct differences between the city locations in a variety of ways.  

### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares

### Averages
When we look at the average fare per ride we see that the cost per ride in the Rural is the most expensive, with the Suburban area being in the midrange between Rural and Urban.  The same is true for the average cost per driver.
In the cost per driver the cost is over $40 more in the Rural cities vs $16.57 in the Urban cities.

### Revenue
From an income perspective, the Urban cities produce the highest revenue stream across the board with the Suburban and Rural cities contributing sucessively less revenue.  While there are fluctuations across the weeks the relative revenue values stay consisten across the 4 months that were plotted.

## Summary

### Overall summary
Based on the statistical evidence there are opportunities to be explored that would reduce the increase the revenue in the smaller communities and at the same time make the services offered more efficient and cost effective for the riders.

### Additional financial support

Despite having much higher average fares, the Rural and SubUrban overall revenue numbers lag behind the Urban cities. The reason for this can be seen in the relatively lower ridership, cost per ride and cost per driver.  Maintianing a fleet and driver contracts at such a low ridership causes higher rates for the riders and lower overall income for the service provider.  In at study of ten communities from Ontario the following recommendations were made.  Look for "financial support from municipla and/or provincial sources". An additional recommendataion was to work out cooperative route offereings by joining resources with other organizations and/or companies that offer ridesharing opportunities nearby.

### Poll the audience
With a very low ridership in Rural areas it would be recommended to understand the reason the ride-share is being used?  No personal vehicle available?  Where are the riders going ... health care, groceries, social activities?  Gaining a better understand of the purpose of travel may well open up opportunities for improvement.  What are their destinations?  Are there common destinations that could be supported on a set schedule?  Are there other resources in the community that also offer specific ride-sharing to those destinations?  For example medical centers, seniors centers, etc.   If other sources are also providing ride-share in the area, even if it is to specific locations only, then there may be the opportunity to combine resources.  Not having to maintain a full set of drivers, and filling the vehicles with a higher capacity may be a solution.

On the RHIhub website they explore "Ridesharing Models" for rural communities. There are several examples of Ridesharing models using the combination approach of pooling resources from different institutions so as to reduce costs.

### Overlap
A third recommendation is to look for location overlaps.  There is already a large pool of drivers in the Urban cities.  Some of those Urban cities will in reality be very close to the edge Suburban cities.  Can the drivers in the borader cities expand their routes/coverage to allow the larger pool of drivers to support the areas with fewer riders and drivers?  Spreading the drivers and fleet resources from larger communities over to smaller ones would reduce the overall cost per ride which would no doubt increase ridership in the lesser served/higher cost communities.
